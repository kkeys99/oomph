# OOMP(H)

An extension of the classic IMP language with object oriented features. Developed for the final project of CS4110 at Cornell University.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites are Python 3.7+ and the [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) library, which can be installed using pip.

### Running OOMP(H)

To run an OOMP(H) file, simply execute `main.py` giving the file to run as an argument:

```
python main.py -f input.oomph
```

You can also run the interpreter interactively by executing `repl.py`. Files in the tests directory can be run by executing `test.py`.
